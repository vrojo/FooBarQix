# FooBarQix
Please find here my implementation of the FooBarQix kata.

## Rules

#### Step 1:
- If the number is divisible by 3, write “Foo” instead of the number
- If the number is divisible by 5, add “Bar”
- If the number is divisible by 7, add “Qix”
- For each digit 3, 5, 7, add “Foo”, “Bar”, “Qix” in the digits order.

#### Step 2:
- We must keep a trace of 0 in numbers, each 0 must be replace par char “*“.
